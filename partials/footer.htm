                You must have no expectation of profit from the work of others. <br><br>

                There is no common enterprise, there shall be no expectation of efforts of a promoter or third party. Users generate their own keys, no one else has keys to give them. Bonuses don't actually take anyone else's database values, they just add or subtract more or less database values based on the system state. <br><br>
                
                If you can, learn to code; or have the smartest coder or computer scientist you can find read over the code you plan to execute. <br><br>
                
                Blockchains, Smart contracts, and Cryptocurrencies, Are all cutting edge technologies, and as such, there is a risk, however small, of total failure. Software is hard. Computers are hard. Distributed software on distributed computers is harder. It's a miracle this stuff works at all. Strong cryptography seems unlikely to be broken, but if it is, everything will probably be broken. <br><br>
                
                The Howey test <br><br>
                
                (<a href="https://www.google.info/search?q=Howey+test" target="_blank">https://www.google.info/search?q=Howey+test</a>) defines what U.S. federal securities laws apply to, which the SEC administers. <br><br>
                
                Wherever possible you agree there is no investment of money. Wherever possible you agree there is no common enterprise. <br><br>
                
                Cryptocurrencies are extremely volatile. Bitcoin went from a penny to $32, then it crashed 94% to $2. Then it went from $2 to $270 then crashed 81%. Then it went from $51 to $1200 then crashed 86%. Then it went from $164 to $20,000, then crashed 84%. Then it went from $3150 to $14,000 and crashed 72%. And that's the most liquid, oldest cryptocurrency in the world. Nearly every crypto currency drops 85% to 95% at some point. Some get back up and make new all time highs. <br><br>
                
                If you've read down this far, congratulations. You will notice the theme of all of the above text is that you should have absolutely no expectations of any sort regarding anything, and if anything goes wrong, you shouldn't look for redress anywhere, and you should receive none. Everything is subject to change at anytime. Software is hard. Blockchain software is harder. Everything could go terribly wrong, and you would be out of luck. We're lucky any of this stuff works at all. A common mistake users make is to send their cryptocurrency directly to a contract address on Ethereum or similar smart contract enabled blockchain. Anything you send, you lose, and will not get back. This nearly always results in the total loss of their funds. The moral of the story here is, on the blockchain, it's very easy to make mistakes, you must be very careful. <br><br>
